## New tutorial setup {#TUTORIAL_15_XXX_NEW_TUTORIAL_SETUP}

As in the previous tutorial, you will find the code integrated into the CMake structure, in `tutorial/14-memory-management`.
In the same way, the project names are adapted to make sure there are no conflicts.

### Tutorial results {#TUTORIAL_15_XXX_NEW_TUTORIAL_SETUP_TUTORIAL_RESULTS}

This tutorial will result in (next to the main project structure):
- a library `output/Debug/lib/baremetal-14.a`
- an application `output/Debug/bin/14-memory-management.elf`
- an image in `deploy/Debug/14-memory-management-image`
