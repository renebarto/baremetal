# Tutorial 21: I2C {#TUTORIAL_21_I2C}

@tableofcontents

## New tutorial setup {#TUTORIAL_21_I2C_NEW_TUTORIAL_SETUP}

As in the previous tutorial, you will find the code integrated into the CMake structure, in `tutorial/18-timer-extension`.
In the same way, the project names are adapted to make sure there are no conflicts.

### Tutorial results {#TUTORIAL_21_I2C_NEW_TUTORIAL_SETUP_TUTORIAL_RESULTS}

This tutorial will result in (next to the main project structure):
- a library `output/Debug/lib/baremetal-21.a`
- a library `output/Debug/lib/stdlib-21.a`
- an application `output/Debug/bin/21-timer-extension.elf`
- an image in `deploy/Debug/21-timer-extension-image`

## Extending the timer {#TUTORIAL_21_I2C_EXTENDING_THE_TIMER}

## Adding interrupts to the timer - Step 1 {#TUTORIAL_21_I2C_ADDING_INTERRUPTS_TO_THE_TIMER___STEP_1}

We'll add some functionality to the `Timer` class for enabling, handling and disabling interrupts on the timer.

### Timer.h {#TUTORIAL_21_I2C_ADDING_INTERRUPTS_TO_THE_TIMER___STEP_1_TIMERH}

Update the file `code/libraries/baremetal/include/baremetal/Timer.h`

```cpp
```

Next: [22-i2s](22-i2s.md)
